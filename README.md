# WizardApp Project

The WizardApp project is a comprehensive solution for managing a magical universe, complete with wizards, spells, and elixirs. It's divided into two main components: the `wizardAPI`, a .NET backend providing RESTful services, and `WizardApp`, a cross-platform Xamarin.Forms application designed for both desktop and Android platforms.

## Features

- **Wizards**: Manage wizard profiles, including their spells and elixirs.
- **Spells and Elixirs**: Add, edit, or delete magical spells and elixirs.
- **Data Synchronization**: Synchronize data between the frontend application and the backend API.
